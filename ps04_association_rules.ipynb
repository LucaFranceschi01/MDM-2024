    "\n",
    "There are three major components of Apriori algorithm, which we describe below using as an example the case where transactions are purchase histories.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Support**: the number of transactions containing a particular item divided by total number of transactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Support(A) = (Transactions containing (A))/(Total Transactions)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Confidence**: normally indicates the likelihood that an item B is also bought if item A is bought. It can be calculated by finding the number of transactions where A and B are bought together, divided by total number of transactions where A is bought:\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Confidence(A→B) = (Transactions containing both (A and B))/(Transactions containing A)*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lift**: the increase in the ratio of sale of B when A is sold. Lift(A –> B) can be calculated by dividing Confidence(A -> B) by Support(B):\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Lift(A→B) = (Confidence (A→B))/(Support (B))*\n",
    "   \n",
    "A Lift of 1 means there is no association between products A and B. Lift greater than 1.0 means products A and B are more likely to be bought together. Lift less than 1.0 indicates two products are unlikely to be bought together.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Apriori algorithm first finds itemsets having the desired level of support, and then within those itemsets tries to derive rules having the desired confidence and lift.\n",
